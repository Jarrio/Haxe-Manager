# Haxe Manager

The aim of this is to enable users to create haxe projects from within VScode and expand the ability of vscode to be a more integrated haxe IDE. If you have any specific project or feature requests let me know and I will try to add it whenever I can. 

If anybody would like to contribute project templates, I am using Haxe's built in [template](https://haxe.org/manual/std-template.html) system as it's simple enough to use for this usecase.  

Go [Here](https://github.com/Jarrio/Haxe-Manager/blob/master/Features.md) for a complete feature list

Please note: *This is still in early development and I will clean up code and make changes as I go through iterations so bare with me :)*
