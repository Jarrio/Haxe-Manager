# Haxe Manager

Enables users to create haxe projects from within VScode and expand the ability of vscode to be a more integrated haxe IDE. If you have any specific project or feature requests let me know and I will try to add it whenever I can. 

If anybody would like to contribute project templates, I am using Haxe's built in [template](https://haxe.org/manual/std-template.html) system as it's simple enough to use for this usecase.  

For now this just helps with boilerplate code :)

I'm slowly working on adding information to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Jarrio/Haxe-Manager/wiki) so if there is anything you don't understand or is missing submit an issue.
Go [here](https://github.com/Jarrio/Haxe-Manager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete changelog

To install the latest stable version go the [vscode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jarrio.hxmanager)

Suggest any features you think would be relevant for this extension!

*Please note: This is still in early development and I will clean up code and make changes as I go through iterations so bear with me*
