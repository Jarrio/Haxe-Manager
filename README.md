# Haxe-Manager

The aim of this is to enable users to create haxe projects from within VScode and other file utilities. If you have any specific project requests let me know and I will try to add it whenever I can. 

If anybody would like to contribute, I am using Haxe's built in [template](https://haxe.org/manual/std-template.html) system as it's simple enough to use for this usecase.  pprojects
