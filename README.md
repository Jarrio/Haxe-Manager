# Haxe Manager

Enables users to create haxe projects from within VScode and expand the ability of vscode to be a more integrated haxe IDE. If you have any specific project or feature requests let me know and I will try to add it whenever I can. 

If anybody would like to contribute project templates, I am using Haxe's built in [template](https://haxe.org/manual/std-template.html) system as it's simple enough to use for this usecase.  

For now this just helps with boilerplate code :)

Go [here](https://github.com/Jarrio/Haxe-Manager/blob/master/Features.md) for a complete feature list

*Please note: This is still in early development and I will clean up code and make changes as I go through iterations so bare with me*

You can copy this repo to the `vscode extensions` folder to install
or 
Install via the `hxmanager-*.*.*.vsix` file and then installing from within vscode ([Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix))

*I will post to the marketplace when I can figure out how to fix the issues I'm having with uploading to it*
